**How to Use This Policy:**

1.  **Replace the bracketed information:** Update `Hangfire UI Extensions`, `5 April, 2025`, the optional permissions explanation, and your contact information.
2.  **Review Permissions Carefully:** Double-check all the permissions your extension requests in its `manifest.json` file. If you are using any permissions that could be perceived as accessing user data, even if you aren't using them for that purpose, you might need to provide a more detailed explanation.
3.  **Host the Policy:** You need to host this Privacy Policy online so you can provide a URL to the Chrome Web Store. You can use free services like:
    * **Google Sites:** Create a simple page with this content.
    * **GitHub Pages:** If you have your extension code on GitHub, you can host a static page.
    * **Privacy Policy Generator Websites:** Some websites offer free privacy policy templates you can customize and host.
4.  **Link in the Developer Dashboard:** When submitting your extension, paste the URL of your hosted Privacy Policy in the designated field.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Be Honest:** While this template is for extensions that don't collect data, ensure it accurately reflects your extension's functionality. If your extension *does* handle any user data in the future, you will need to update your privacy policy accordingly.
* **Transparency is Key:** Even though you aren't collecting data, being transparent about what your extension *does* and *doesn't* do builds trust with potential users.

By using a clear and concise privacy policy like this, you can fulfill the Chrome Web Store's requirement while accurately representing your extension's data handling practices (or lack thereof).
